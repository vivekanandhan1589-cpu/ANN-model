📊 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using historical customer data. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is built to identify customers who are likely to stop using a company’s service, helping businesses improve customer retention strategies.

🎯 Business Objective

Predict whether a customer will churn or not

Identify key factors influencing customer churn

Support business decisions for customer retention
